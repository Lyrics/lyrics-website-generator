# Open Lyrics Database website generator

This build tool compliments [lyrics.git](https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics) to create static HTML files in `./www/`. The contents of that directory can then be uploaded to a server to become a fully functional lyrics website.

## Requirements

    sudo apt-get install sassc
    pip3 install pystache simple-http-server

The lyrics database repository (or your fork) must exist one directory
level up from this repo.


## Build

    make clean all


## Run local web server

    make serve
